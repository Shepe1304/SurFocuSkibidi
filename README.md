# BrainRot: SurFocuSkibidi ðŸ§  

**WARNING:** This project is scientifically engineered to turn your brain into a puddle of goo. Use with extreme caution (or don't, we're not your mom).

## The Premise: Focus Through Chaos? 

We took the concept of "productive suffering" and cranked it. BrainRot is based on the revolutionary idea that the best way to focus is to unleash a torrent of distractions upon your poor, unsuspecting brain. 

Think of it like training for a marathon by running through a bouncy castle while juggling chainsaws and reciting the alphabet backwards. It *might* work... or it might just make you question your life choices.

## How to Achieve Peak Brain Rot

1. **Dad Joke Onslaught:** Brace yourself for a barrage of puns so bad they'll make you want to hide under your desk.  Example: "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!" 
2. **Subway Surfers Mayhem:**  Witness the mesmerizing chaos of Subway Surfers gameplay looping endlessly in the background.  Try to focus on your work while Jake and the gang dodge trains and collect coins. We dare you.
3. **"Focus" Mode (lol):**  Attempt to do something productive (writing, coding, contemplating the meaning of life) while your senses are assaulted by the aforementioned distractions. Good luck with that.

## Features That Will Make You Question Our Sanity

* **Dad Joke Generator:**  We've scraped the internet for the most groan-worthy dad jokes known to humankind.
* **Subway Surfers on Repeat:**  Prepare to be hypnotized by the endless runner. You'll start seeing trains in your sleep.
* **Distraction Level Control:** Choose your level of brain rot. Go for a gentle simmer or crank it up to a full-blown meltdown.
* **"Focus" Timer:** Track how long you can withstand the onslaught before your brain turns to mush.
* **Share Your Suffering:**  Brag to your friends about how much brain rot you can handle.
